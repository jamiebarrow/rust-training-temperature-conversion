I remember learning Visual Basic by implementing a simple Celcius to Fahrenheit
conversion application as part of a tutorial.

This is a simple Rust implementation of a very basic command line utility that
asks the user for a temperature in Celcius, and then prints out the temperature
in Fahrenheit.

```shell
Enter temperature in Celcius:
100
100 degrees Celcius = 212 degrees Fahrenheit
```
